# TODO

-   [ ] Up / Down for history - perhaps using the in-memory `cards` that already exist
-   [ ] Sidebar navigation
-   [ ] In-app documentation (maybe via sidebar?)
-   [ ] Non-interactive externals should require a keypress before the window closes
-   [ ] Save/restore session
-   [ ] configuration so we can change the table like `border: 2px solid green` and change alignment like `center` or `left`
-   [ ] would love to have some drag-n-drop gui widgets, maybe from the sidebar navigation
-   [ ] hook up more ansi colors - may have to look into nushell's `is_tty` function that strips ansi and make it work for nana
-   [x] have the input and output areas distinguishable by background color
-   [x] please give me `dark` mode

# Brainstorming

-   [ ] maybe add a green checkmark that also commits/executes a command
-   [ ] yes, i want an easter egg - i have one in mind :) it's a secret but it goes with the theme
